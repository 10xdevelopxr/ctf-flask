# Homepage for XYZ Technologies 💻
This is my first project as XYZ after I joined as a Junior Software Engineer last week. I am hoping to use my DevOps knowledge and use proper DevOps principles to build and test this website!


# Free-to-use 🙋‍♂️
Feel free to customize this page and use for your own needs. I did the same. :p


> P.S. This is under development. Await for some huge changes in the near future! 😊
